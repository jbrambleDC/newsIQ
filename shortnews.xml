And yet . . . The Chinese have described themselves as "A plate of scattered sand grains" that would never join or unite with each other.  Piset, in his latest Awakening Dragon column, tells the story of Two Bridges to illustrate just some of the underlying dynamics of China's explosive economic growth. </description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:52:18</pubdate>

The advisory talks about the use of Caller-ID spoofing the customers number, allowing a bypass of the PIN code since the voicemail thinks that the customer is calling to check their own voicemail. According to Secure Science Corporation, there has been no response from the vendors. Comments have been posted that T-Mobile has optional PIN code protection off by default.

Occasionally said computer will belong to a client, family member, friend or otherwise very important person who needs said computer back with data. In most business envrionments user data should be on the server and the following process is not typically appropriate. This process is Windows specific, and will help you deal with Windows less than graceful failures when taken over by viruses, trojans, spyware or has been hacked.    If you do not have data to recover, or an substantial operational need to keep that exact install, then just wipe the drive and reinstall the Operating System. There are times however when you really need to recover a system and format c:\\ is not an option. This process is not intended to be all inclusive, but to give you a starting point so that you can start doing other needed system repairs and or recover files safely. Fundamentally a recovered system that has been owned can be recovered, but never again should be considered known or trusted. It is always better to wipe and reinstall, but it is not always an option.</description><rank>2</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:17</pubdate>

In short, I was amazed and tantalized by his short films and music videos.  Even if you haven't heard of him, you've probably seen his many works in Gap commercials, various music videos, and the recent movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.    Many of his works explode with visual elements that, when taken alone, are simple and mundane.  However, under his masterful guidance, these elements come together to form a highly mesmerizing visual experience.  He never ceases to push visual technologies and challenge our ideas about the visual medium.</description><rank>2</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:32</pubdate>

This requires long range autonomous strike weaponry. The Joint Strike Fighter does not solve this issue and detrimentally places added pressure on Australia's limited force of aerial refuelling assets. The world's defence manufacturers are not creating strike platforms that solve Australian needs. For this reason, Australia needs to look to other nations with similar defence needs. In this case, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all face defending an air-sea gap. Australia should enter a partnership with these nations to create a strike fighter that satisfies the strategic needs of defending an air-sea gap. The benefits of such a partnership will be many.</description><rank>2</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:40</pubdate>

Unfortunately, they also teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various artists) to make this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.</description><rank>2</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:52</pubdate>

The use of\Adolf Hitler by any campaign, politician or party is simply wrong."\\Which of course is a mistake.  I went and downloaded the video (which is just\stupid btw.

The advisory talks about the use of Caller-ID spoofing the customers number, allowing a bypass of the PIN code since the voicemail thinks that the customer is calling to check their own voicemail. According to Secure Science Corporation, there has been no response from the vendors. Comments have been posted that T-Mobile has optional PIN code protection off by default.

Occasionally said computer will belong to a client, family member, friend or otherwise very important person who needs said computer back with data. In most business envrionments user data should be on the server and the following process is not typically appropriate. This process is Windows specific, and will help you deal with Windows less than graceful failures when taken over by viruses, trojans, spyware or has been hacked.    If you do not have data to recover, or an substantial operational need to keep that exact install, then just wipe the drive and reinstall the Operating System. There are times however when you really need to recover a system and format c:\\ is not an option. This process is not intended to be all inclusive, but to give you a starting point so that you can start doing other needed system repairs and or recover files safely. Fundamentally a recovered system that has been owned can be recovered, but never again should be considered known or trusted. It is always better to wipe and reinstall, but it is not always an option.</description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:17</pubdate>

In short, I was amazed and tantalized by his short films and music videos.  Even if you haven't heard of him, you've probably seen his many works in Gap commercials, various music videos, and the recent movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.    Many of his works explode with visual elements that, when taken alone, are simple and mundane.  However, under his masterful guidance, these elements come together to form a highly mesmerizing visual experience.  He never ceases to push visual technologies and challenge our ideas about the visual medium.</description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:32</pubdate>

This requires long range autonomous strike weaponry. The Joint Strike Fighter does not solve this issue and detrimentally places added pressure on Australia's limited force of aerial refuelling assets. The world's defence manufacturers are not creating strike platforms that solve Australian needs. For this reason, Australia needs to look to other nations with similar defence needs. In this case, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all face defending an air-sea gap. Australia should enter a partnership with these nations to create a strike fighter that satisfies the strategic needs of defending an air-sea gap. The benefits of such a partnership will be many.</description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:40</pubdate>

Unfortunately, they also teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various artists) to make this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives. But I hope you find it useful, and perhaps feel inspired to do something similar, if or when the same thing has happened in your area.</description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-18 22:59:52</pubdate>

It is a product that does something useful, does it really well, and looks terrific too. None of these factors on their own is enough to make the iPod mini a success; their combination, through deft and creative implementation of function, is what makes the difference. Add in some tried and tested limited supply marketing, a store that looks as good as Louis Vuitton and a high impact award winning advertising campaign that has covered Tokyo in pink, green and yellow for weeks, and some of the reasons for the iPod mini phenomenon can be understood. #148; Aug 10</description><rank>5</rank><pubdate>2004-08-19 04:50:47</pubdate>
